    <p class="caption-text">In 1918, in the New York Public Library, George Washington's recipe for making beer in his own handwriting was discovered among the pages of a military notebook he kept while overseeing troops in Virginia during the French and Indian war. While camping with his troops in 1757, he scrawled these instructions for "small beer," a porter made with molasses. The original recipe is still housed in the library's main building.</p>

    <p class="caption-text">Designed by Theobald Engelhardt and built in 1889 as the home of Henry Claus and his wife, Catherina Lipsius. They sold the home in 1902 to Dr. Frederick Cook (not to be confused with the 18th century British explorer James Cook), a physician and arctic explorer who claimed to be the first man to reach the summit of Alaska’s Denali (formerly Mount McKinley) in 1906. He later claimed he was the first man to reach the North Pole in 1908, contradicting Robert Peary’s claim that he was the first, and triggering a widely publicized dispute. Both of Cook's claims were eventually discredited. He later served 7 years in prison for stock fraud. The house was sold to an Italian family in 1920, then became a convent, then a doctor's clinic, then abandoned, and now has new owners.</p>

    <p class="caption-text">The Union Grounds were built in 1862 on the outskirts of the nearby town of Wallabout, at today's Marcy Ave & Lynch St. It was the first to fence in the playing field and charge spectators.</p>

    <p class="caption-text">Chadwick lived in Brooklyn and came to be known as the "Father of Baseball." He is credited with creating the statistics of batting average and earned run average (ERA) as well as box scores and the abbreviation "K" that designates a strikeout.</p>

He shared the recipe with a friend at Meister Brau, which followed thereafter. Miller bought Meister Brau in 1972 and launched Miller Lite in 1975, supported with &quot;Tastes Great, Less Filling,&quot; the iconic campaign created by McCann-Erickson.</p>

In July of 1935, Manhattan beer giant George Ehret’s son Louis J. Ehret purchased the Interboro facility and later, the brewery was acquired by Joseph Schlitz in 1949. The brewery closed in 1950.</p>
